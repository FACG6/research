### What kind of task are normally handled in the back end & and the front end ?

### **Front End**
  * Its the UI that are going to show and collect data for and from the user and show some interactive .
  * The web site should be responsive , dynamic and easy to use.

### **Back End**
* the backedn used to store and anylize the data .

* Some of the back end fucntion .

* Database creation , Api intergration , and managment , Secaurity .

### **What are client-side and server-side ?**
* in the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server side
The problem with hosting all of these processes on the server side is that each request involving one of them has to travel all the way from the client to the server, every time
means everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client

* Js was orginaly designed to run int the browser
client side refers to everthing in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user dievice )
this includes what the user sees , such as text and imags , along with any actions that an applicaiton performs within the user sees , such as text and names along with any actions that an apllicaiotn performs within the user’s browser
simply means running scripts , such as JavasScript on the client device, usually within a browser .

* Let talk alittle about the server side
the server side is a computer application that are rachable from a user local computer or any device
server side first used to store a large mount of data that can’t be handled from on device
and we will talk aobut it more in the next point’s .

### ** What Exactly Is “Back-End Development? **
back-end development to be any kind of development that doesn’t involve creating code that produces a user interface.

### ** What Do Back-End Developers Do? **

* In the web development world, most back-end developers concern themselves with building the actual logic behind the application they are working on.

* Often, front-end developers will build out a user interface, and back-end developers will write code that makes it all work.

* For example, a front-end developer might create a screen in an application with a button to press to get the customer’s data.
A back-end developer might write the code that makes that button work by figuring out what data to fetch from the database for the appropriate customer and delivering it back to the front-end, where it is eventually displayed.

### ** Top 5 server side languages are:**

* Node.js (JavaScript)
    Node.js is the newest in the list and the fastest growing today. The JavaScript that you use for front-end rendering can also be used in the back-end.
* PHP
    PHP is by far the most used server-side scripting language. Just above 80% of websites are running on PHP. The reason is that it was the first programming language that was designed for the web
* Java
    Java is another popular language that is used in many major websites.
* Ruby
    Ruby is largely popular for small applications as it is suitable for rapid web development.
* Python
    Python is one of the best programming languages for beginners, not just for web development, but also to learn to program.

as we mentioned before
you will notice that the window’s object is missing
but node js have global object insted
another differnce that node js build on event , call back , modules
theres some tool to help to develope in the node

* mocha js : for testing
Mocha.js is a JavaScript test framework based on Node.js. It enables you to test both in console and in the browser. You can use this really fast testing suite to do the unit and integration testing plus it works for TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) perfectly.

* chai : for TDD and BDD
* Express.js
Express.js is a must-use minimalist framework for Node.js web applications. A combination of Node.js and Express.js enables you to build software with JavaScript on the server side
