THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

[4] J. Sparks.

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

[4] J. Sparks.

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.

THE
EARLY LIFE OF WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER FIRST.
Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.

George Washington was born in Virginia, on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular place of his birth was Pope’s Creek, Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland. The name of his great grandfather was John Washington, who came from the north of England and settled on Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655. He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter of the gentleman from whom the Creek took its name. John Washington is believed to have been a military man in early life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed thus: “The will of Lieutenant Colonel Washington.” This will contains a small bequest to the church, and affords evidence that he was a pious man. As the parish in which he lived has always borne his name, he was probably very instrumental in establishing it.

[10]

John Washington had three children, Lawrence, John and Ann. Lawrence Washington, the oldest son and the grandfather of George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin Washington, the son of Lawrence and the father of George, was born in the year 1694. He was probably the eldest son of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial estate at Pope’s Creek.

Augustin Washington was married twice. His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence, Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived to be men. The second wife was Mary Ball, a young lady of highly respectable family in the northern part of Virginia.—George was the first fruit of this union. He was the oldest of six children, viz. George, Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George was baptized April the 5th, 1732.

The church of England was then almost the only denomination of Christians in the colony of Virginia. The parents of George Washington were members of this church, and brought up their family in the habit of regular attendance on public worship.

[11]

The first school that George attended, was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man, who was both the school master and the sexton of the parish. By this old man, the father of his country was first taught to read. Although George’s father sent him to this school, he took upon himself the oversight of his education, and the pleasing duty of early instilling into his mind the principles of piety and virtue. His manner of doing this appears by the following anecdotes, which were related to the Rector of Mount Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased, who, as a friend and relative, spent many of her youthful days in the family.

One fine morning in the autumn of 1737, Mr. Washington, having George, then five years old, by the hand, came to the door and invited cousin Washington and myself to walk with them to the orchard, promising to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, we were presented with a fine sight indeed. The ground, as far as we could see, was covered with mellow apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of their fruit. “George,” said his father, “don’t you remember, my son, when this good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple, last spring, that I could hardly[12] prevail upon you to divide it with your brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember I then told you we ought to be generous to each other because the Almighty is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite confused. “Now look around, my son,” continued his father, “and see how kindly the Almighty has treated us, and learn from this how we ought to treat our fellow creatures.” George looked a while in silence on the abundance of fruit before him, then lifting his eyes to his father, he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so stingy any more.”

Mr. Augustine Washington took great pains early to inspire his son George with the love of truth. The following anecdote shows that his endeavors were not without success.

When George was about six years old, he became the owner of a hatchet, with which, like most other little boys, he was very much delighted. He went about chopping every thing that came in his way. One day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet upon the body of a beautiful young English cherry tree, which[13] he cut so badly that the tree never recovered from the injury. The next morning his father seeing what had befallen the tree, which, by the by, was a great favorite with him, came into the house, and with much warmth, asked who had done the mischief, declaring at the same time, that he would not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody could tell him any thing about it. Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance. “George,” said his father, “do you know who cut that beautiful cherry tree yonder in the garden?” George was taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment; but he soon recovered himself.—Looking at his father, he said, “I will not tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.” The delighted father, embracing his child, said, “No matter about the tree, George; you have frankly told me the truth. Though you saw I was offended, you were not afraid to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness this noble conduct in my son is of more value to me than a thousand such trees.”

Mr. Washington took the following method to impress upon his son the existence and wisdom of God from the evidence of design in his works.

[14]

On a bed in the garden, well prepared for the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters of his son’s name. He then very carefully sowed seed in the small furrows made by the stick, covered it over and smoothed the ground nicely with a roller. In a few days the seed came up, and exhibited in large letters, the words George Washington.—They soon caught the eye for which they were intended. Again and again the astonished boy read his name, springing up from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to his father and exclaimed, “O father! come here! come with me and I will show you such a sight as you never saw in all your life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he tugged him along through the garden to the spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did you ever see such a sight before?” “It is a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father, who made my name there?” “It grew there, my son.” “I know it grew there, but who made the letters so as to spell my name?” “Did they not grow so by chance, my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,” said George, “ever saw a single letter grow up by chance; and how could a whole name grow up so even and be spelled so[15] exactly right by chance? Somebody planted it so.” “That is true, George. I planted it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters could not grow so as to spell your name by chance, how could the world and all the things and creatures in it be made so exactly suited to each other and to some useful purpose, by chance?”

Thus happily and profitably to young Washington passed the days of his earliest years. Mr. Washington’s family government was steady and reasonable; his treatment of his children was kind and affectionate. George was an intelligent boy and a dutiful son. Never were parent and child more strongly attached. But, in the providence of God, only a few years more were to be allowed them for the enjoyment of each other’s society, on earth.

About the year 1739, when George was about seven years old, his father removed from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm which he owned in Stafford county, on the Rappahannock river, directly opposite to Fredericksburg.

Lawrence Washington, the elder of George’s two half-brothers, became of age in 1739, and soon afterwards received a[16] Captain’s commission in a regiment raised in America, and served with the British forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth. Having been absent in the army about two years, Captain Washington returned to Virginia. A few months after his return, his father was taken ill.—George was then on a visit to some of his acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King George county, about twenty miles from his father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at first unwilling to interrupt George in the enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness became alarming, George was sent for, and reached home but just in time to receive the parting blessing of his beloved father. He died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of forty-nine years. George was then eleven years old.

CHAPTER SECOND.
Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother Augustine about three years, and attends Mr. Williams’s school—his manuscript book of forms—his rules of behavior.

About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington married Ann, the daughter of Mr. William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas Fairfax.

[17]

Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon. He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine Washington and her family continued to reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon her now devolved the care of the plantation. Her first born son, George, continued to live with her some months after his father’s death. During this period, a circumstance happened which shows that George, though a good boy on the whole, was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness. His mother owned a beautiful colt, which, never having been broken, was remarkably wild. George delighted to look at this colt as he pranced about the pasture, snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting and displaying his fine proportions. He often wished himself upon the colt’s back. One day he engaged some of his school companions to come early the next morning and help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They came, and found the colt at no great distance from the house. After a great deal of difficulty they contrived to corner him and put a bridle upon him. Several boys[18] held the bridle while George leaped upon his back. A violent struggle followed.—The horse seemed determined to shake off his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined to keep his seat. At length the noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell headlong and burst a blood vessel. This killed him instantly. George received no injury by the fall; but when he saw the poor creature lie dead, and considered his mother’s attachment to the animal, he began to look very serious. The call to breakfast was soon heard. Some of George’s companions had been invited to take breakfast with him that morning. The boys were all remarkably silent at the table. Whether Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired if they had seen any thing of her fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither of the boys replied to this question. She repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s character for truth and frankness had been tried when he was much younger. It did not then fail; it must not now fail. “Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs. Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I[19] will tell you, mother. I am the one in fault.” He then related all the circumstances just as they happened. “I very much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs. Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son frankly tell the truth, without showing any disposition to cast his own faults upon others.”

Soon after this occurrence, George was sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity, to live with his half-brother Augustine. The chief object of sending him there was that he might have the benefit of a respectable school in the neighborhood, kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with his half-brother and attended that school about three years. An old gentleman, who was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that time, has often said that such was George’s reputation for truth, impartiality and good judgment among his schoolmates, that they were continually referring their disputes to him, and so great was their confidence in him, that his decisions were seldom called in question. He said nothing was more common, when the boys were in high dispute about some question of fact, than for one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George Washington was there! George Washington[20] was there! He knows all about it; and if he don’t say it was so, why then we will give it up.”
Though George Washington was naturally of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually gentle and obliging in his conduct. He never quarrelled with his companions; and he would always endeavor to settle their quarrels with each other. If he could not calm their passions and prevent their fighting by his arguments, he would inform the instructor of their barbarous intentions; though by doing so he often brought upon himself their censure at the time.

At Mr. Williams’s school, George was taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book Keeping, Surveying and Geography.[1] He wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand. The number and accuracy of his geometrical figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical studies. When he was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript book, which he entitled “Forms of Writing.” In it he copied out with great care and exactness, forms of different kinds used in the transaction of business, such as[21] a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond, an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow two or three select pieces of poetry. Among them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then follow a collection of a hundred and ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These he entitles “Rules of civility and proper behavior in company and conversation.” He does not mention from what source he derived these rules. They seem well calculated to improve the manners and morals of a young person, and no doubt had a favorable influence in forming the future deportment and character of Washington. The following is a selection from these rules.

[1] Weems.

1. Every action in company ought to be respectful to those present.

2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.

3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when you should hold your peace; walk not on when others stop.

4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog not the table or desk on which another is reading or writing; lean not on any one.

5. Be no flatterer.

6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.[22] Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of them unasked: also look not nigh when another is writing a letter.

7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters somewhat grave.

8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of another, though he were your enemy.

9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow passage, give way for him to pass.

10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places the precedency.

11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us, with whom we ought not to begin.

12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and comprehensive.

13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to play the physician.

14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his due title, according to his degree and the custom of the place.

15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which he professes: it savors of arrogancy.

16. When a person does all he can, do not blame him, though he does not succeed.

17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider whether it ought to be done in public or in private, presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it; and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it with mildness.

[23]

18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.

19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.

20. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, nor revile.

21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage of others.

22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate nature rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil and orderly with respect to times and places.

23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about your person to see if you be well decked, and if your clothes set handsomely.

24. Associate with persons of good character, if you have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone, than in bad company.

25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy; and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.

26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret.

27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be believed.

28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride no man’s misfortune.

29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.

[24]

30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to salute, hear and answer.

31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in commending.

32. Give not advice without being asked.

33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.

34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of others; nor ask how they came.

35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly, nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly.

36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do not in general help him out, nor prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till he has done speaking.

37. Treat with men about business only at fit times. Whisper not in company.

38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of the company be commended for a brave or virtuous action, commend not another immediately upon it for a similar action.

39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do not always name your author. Discover not a secret.

40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others; neither approach those who are speaking in private.

41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be careful to keep your promises.

[25]

42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, nor repeat the same thing often.

43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.

44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.

45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table; but if the master of the house will have it so, contend not, lest you trouble the company.

46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents.

47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.

48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.

CHAPTER THIRD.
Came very near entering the British Navy at the age of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the Indian war dance—continues surveying three years—is appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon estate.

While George lived with his half-brother Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence. He was also instructed in the art of[26] fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards accompanied him against the French as his interpreter.[2]

[2] J. Sparks.

In the summer of 1746, George left Mr. Williams’s school in Westmoreland county, and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford county. He was then about fourteen years old. Soon after his return he became very desirous to enter the British navy.—His half-brother Lawrence approved his choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s inclination for the navy should be gratified. They both used their influence with his mother in favor of the project. She at first seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence procured him a midshipman’s warrant. But as the time of separation drew near, her maternal feelings and more mature reflection caused his mother to waver in her decision. She suggested many objections to the plan; and seemed to listen with more satisfaction to those who opposed, than to those who approved of it. In September, during her suspense upon the subject, George went to see and further consult his brother Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion[27] he spent a little time at the house of Mr. William Fairfax, who is said to have been an amiable and excellent man. During this visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was willing to follow the advice of his brother Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return home, however, George found his mother so decidedly opposed to his going to sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at the thought of his leaving her, that he gave it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness. When we consider that this scheme was suited to captivate his youthful fancy, that it was encouraged by some of his most judicious friends, and that the necessary preparations were made for carrying it into effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful regard highly honorable to him. It must be admitted that the mother’s feelings were truly parental, and her wishes reasonable, when it is considered that George was her eldest son, that his father was dead, and that she was left with five younger children.—This decision was probably an event of Providence, upon which the very existence of the United States, as an independent nation, depended.

[28]

After this, George lived a part of his time with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, and a part of the time with his mother, near Fredericksburg, and went to school in that town. Here he made great improvement in the art of surveying.

In March, 1748, being then sixteen years old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated with Mr. George Fairfax, in the employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They set out on a surveying tour to the western parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied by their assistants, and travelled in a north westerly direction, nearly in range with the Potomac. The first day they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax, in Frederick county, passing through beautiful groves of sugar trees, and admiring the richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah. The next day they sent on their baggage to a place now called Winchester, and worked industriously for several succeeding days, surveying land in the neighborhood. They then travelled about forty miles further into the country, in a continual rain, swimming their horses over the rivers, which were then very high. Just after the rain ceased and the weather had cleared away, they were agreeably surprised by the[29] appearance of more than thirty friendly Indians, returning from war. The surveying party remained to witness the performance of their war dance. After clearing a large space of ground and making a fire in the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves around the fire. The speaker then made a grand speech, in which he told them in what manner they were to dance. When the speech was ended, the best dancer jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep, and ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was soon followed by the others, in a similar style. Their dance was accompanied by appropriate music.—One Indian beat time upon a deer-skin stretched tightly over a vessel half full of water, while another rattled a gourd shell with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail tied to it, to make it look finely.

One windy night, about a week after, the straw on which Washington was asleep, in the tent, took fire; but one of the party fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it. A few days after, their tent was blown down by the violence of the wind. They occasionally shot a wild turkey or two, which they cooked upon forked sticks instead of spits, and ate upon large chips instead of[30] plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling about all day, they usually camped out in the forest, and slept with their clothes on all night. During this tour, young Washington and his party surveyed between two and three thousand acres of land, and arrived safely home on the 12th of April, having been absent just one month.

For three years, young Washington was occupied nearly all the time, when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the Alleghany mountains and on the southern branches of the river Potomac.[3] His surveying expeditions were attended with so many hardships and privations, that he was rarely out more than a few weeks at a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals of these expeditions, he made it his home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon, though he passed a part of his time with his mother.[4]

In the year 1751, young Washington, though but nineteen years of age, was appointed Adjutant General of the northern division of the Virginia militia, with the rank of Major.[5]

[5] Marshall.

The health of his brother Lawrence had been declining for several years. He had[31] made a voyage to England, and afterwards passed some time at the Bath springs, in Virginia, without receiving any material benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751, he decided to take a voyage to the West Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his physicians. By his request, his brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him on this voyage. They sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the 28th of September, and arrived there about the 3d of November. They procured a pleasant and airy place to board, near the sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality and attention by the principal inhabitants on the island. George was pleased with the richness of the soil, the value of the crops, the variety and excellence of the fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects in every direction. He was seized with the small pox on the 17th of November, and it was nearly a month before he recovered from it. On the 22d of November, he embarked on board a vessel called the Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous passage of more than five weeks, he arrived in Virginia.

[32]

Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected from the climate of Barbadoes, went to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing to fail, he returned home in the course of the summer, and died at Mount Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at Mount Vernon when his brother died, and immediately took charge of his affairs. On opening his will, it was found that he had given to George the Mount Vernon estate, and some valuable lands in Berkley county, Virginia.

CHAPTER FOURTH.
Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly escapes being killed by an Indian—came near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits Queen Aliquippa.

Information had been received, from time to time, that the French were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory, beyond the Allegany mountains, and that a French army was approaching from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river and to take possession of the whole country. As this territory was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that[33] colony[6] resolved to send a messenger with a letter to the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain important facts, and to make useful observations. Major George Washington was selected for this arduous undertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of living and travelling in the woods acquired on his surveying expeditions, and certain traits in his character, well fitted him for this delicate and important mission, though he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He was commissioned by the Governor on the 30th of October, 1753, and the same day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On the 14th of November he arrived at the mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on the river Potomac, having engaged a French interpreter and procured the necessary supply of provisions, horses, &c., on the way. Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an Indian interpreter, and four other men as attendants; and with these men, left the place the next day. The excessive rains and the vast quantities of snow which had fallen, prevented their reaching the river Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here[34] they learned that expresses had been sent down the river a few days before, with information of the French General’s death, and the return of the greater part of the French troops into winter quarters.

[6] Dinwiddie.

As the late rains had rendered the rivers impassable without swimming their horses, Washington sent two of his men, with the baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg. As young Washington arrived at the fork before the canoe, he spent some time in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and Allegany, at and near their junction which forms the Ohio, and examining the land in the fork, which, having the command of both rivers, he thought well situated for a fort.

On the Allegany river, about two miles above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the English. Washington, with his attendants, called upon this chief, and invited him to attend a council at a place called Logstown, about twenty miles west of his residence. He accepted the invitation, and accompanied Washington and his men to Logstown.—They arrived about sunset. Washington[35] found that the friendly chief, called the Half-King, whom he particularly wished to see, was out at his hunting cabin on little Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant. Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed the Half-King’s principal man at Logstown that he was a messenger to the French commandant, and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations and inform them of the fact. He then gave him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King. The man promised to dispatch a runner for him the next morning. Washington invited him and other chief men to his tent in the evening. They came and staid about an hour. About three o’clock in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King arrived. He told Washington that the French had lately built two forts about fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and the other on French Creek, which falls into the Allegany from the north, and near a small lake. He gave Washington a plan of both these forts, of his own drawing. He said the present French commandant was at the fort on French Creek, and that he could not reach in less than five or six nights sleep, in good travelling. The next day,[36] Washington met several chiefs in council, and delivered a friendly speech to them, in which he briefly stated the object of his visit, and requested an escort of warriors to the French commandant. This was replied to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners were dispatched very early the next morning, for the purpose of assembling a more full council, but not many came.—It was, however, agreed to furnish Washington and his men a convoy, to consist of three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake and White Thunder, and one of their best hunters.

They all set out from Logstown on the 30th of November, and travelled in continual bad weather till the 4th of December, when they reached Venango, a settlement at the place where French Creek falls into the Allegany river. This place is now the town of Franklin, the capital of Venango county. They saw the French colors flying at a house in Venango. Washington went immediately to the house to inquire where the commandant resided. Here he found a Captain and three other French officers.—The Captain informed him that he, himself, had the immediate command on the river, but that there was a general officer at the[37] first fort above, to which he advised him to proceed with his dispatches. He invited Washington and his party to sup with him and his officers, and treated them with great complaisance. The badness of the weather and the winning treatment which the Indians received from the French, combined to detain Washington and his party at Venango three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied them up the Creek. The travelling was so bad they did not reach the fort on French Creek till the 12th of December.

The French commandant was the Chevalier de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military order of St. Louis. Washington waited on him soon after his arrival, and was received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. Washington acquainted the Chevalier with his business, and presented his commission and letter. While the commandant was in consultation with his officers upon the communication from the Governor of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington embraced the opportunity of examining the strength and taking the dimensions of the fort, and of making other observations. He was satisfied that the garrison contained upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his[38] people, by his direction, took an account of upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up and prepared to convey the French forces down the river at the proper season.
